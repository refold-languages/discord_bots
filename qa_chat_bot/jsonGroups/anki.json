Learning a language is a long journey, and we genuinely do believe that with Anki, the process will go a little faster. If you find Anki a terrible part of the process, then try not going so hard with it. Even 5 words or less a day can help. Just pick a manageable number for yourself and go with it. Even 5 a day is better than nothing and should keep your review time low and manageable. "],

This way, your known cards stay where they are, and forgotten cards begin to refresh.\n\nWith that said, if you wish to restart your deck, the best way is to delete the deck and load it in fresh. This ensures all cards are in the intended order (Make sure you still have access to the fresh Anki deck before deleting the old one). You can also select cards from the Anki browser and right-click them, selecting \"reschedule...\" and sending them to the back of the card queue.

      "responses": ["Anki is a supplement to immersion. Many people get into the trap of thinking more Anki means quicker progress. In reality, it's the balance of Anki to immersion that leads to more rapid progress. The recommended amount of cards per day is 10-20, but less is also acceptable. Also, keep in mind that new words will be harder to learn early in the process because you have nothing to associate new words to. So your early cards per day may be much less. Find a balance that works for you.\n\n**Another way to look at cards per day**\nAnother way to look at cards per day is to not add a specific amount of cards per day at all. Some have found success in allotting a time for Anki rather than a card count. My personal recommendation is that you should be doing a MAX (less is fine) of 30 minutes of Anki for every 1.5 hours of immersion (for a total of 2 hours) with an Anki cap of 2 hours. So at 3 hours of immersion, you have 1 hour of Anki (4 hours total), and at 6 hours of immersion, you cap out at 2 hours of Anki and just add more immersion beyond this. I like this method because it ensures that you don't cut into immersion time to keep up on your Anki card goal.\n\nIf you chose the time method above, it's important to note that you always finish your reps for the day. If you run out of time, finish your backlog of cards, but don't add new cards. If you have time, add as many new cards as you can for that day in the remaining time. I do recommend capping your daily cards, though, at 20-30 max, even if you have time remaining, so you trickle cards out and don't have huge swings in cards per day."],

Because of this, we recommend setting your leeches at 5 and allowing leeched cards to suspend or delete.\nNote: Every time you get a card wrong, it goes into a **learning** mode. Marking a card incorrect when in learning mode does not add a counter to the leech number. So if you get a card wrong that day, and then that same day you mark it wrong 10 more times without ever getting it correct, this still only counts as 1 leech counter. Only after you mark it correct, then see it again on a different day, will marking it incorrect add a counter to the leech counter."],

So I'll go over the pros and cons, and you can make your own choice.\n\n    Pros Camp:\n1. It makes sentence mining quick.\n2. Perfect for people with not a lot of time\n3. Can use frequency list to find useful words easily.\n\nCons Camp:\n1. Time save is an illusion as all-time sentence mining is not immersion (as opposed to finding sentence while immersing)\n2. Morphman can be buggy. It often shows you words you have already marked known. Sorting through this wastes more time.\n3. Sentence context is not as concrete and leads to a weaker understanding of the word.\n4. Once you have a little sentence mining experience, mining in immersion is faster and leads to better sentences.\n5. You are often given 2T+ sentences that appear 1T that make the sentence not very high quality to use.\n\nIn the end, it's up to you if you use morphman or not. My Creator (Brett) and many in the server don't like using it. He used to live by it and refused to not use it. When it broke on him, he was forced to sentence mine during immersion, and this was the best thing that happened to him. Being forced into it made him realize how much better an experience it is. However, many also disagree with this and enjoy the addon."],

This allows for sentence mining and lookups on mobile. Sadly there is no equivelent for iPhone (any devs out there want to port the Android app linked below, post it in the Discord.). Reading lookups and sentence making are possible with the Anki app on and just simple copy paste on iPhone, but for now there is no multimedia card creation tools sadly. Only for android.\n\n(Note: There are always to make it work. On iPhone you can listen to your immersion and try and look up words you don't know just by looking up words by hand in the dictionary. Don't let the tools be the reason you don't continue forward. They are nice, but not nessesary. Get your immersion however you can."],
