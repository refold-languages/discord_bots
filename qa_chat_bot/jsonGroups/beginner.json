    "responses": ["Make sure you check out the resources in <#784120941650509865> as this is answered there in much greater detail than I can cover here. But in short, the goal of stage 1 is to build a foundation. This generally entails 3 daily activities.\n\n**1. Daily Foundation Vocabulary (Anki/flashcards)**\n Slowly work through your vocabulary foundation deck. For more information on foundation vocabulary, ask me \"**How do I get a vocabulary foundation**\".\n\n**2. Browse Grammar Guide**\nFor 10-20 minutes a day, you can help jumpstart comprehension by casually browsing a beginner grammar guide. For more info on grammar, ask me \"**How should I learn grammar?**\".\n\n **3. Immersion**\n This is the most critical element of the process. You want to immerse at least 3 times more than you do Anki (flashcards). For more info on immersion, ask me \"**What do I do when immersing in stage 1**\"."],
