If I don't respond or if I give the wrong answer, try asking the question another way. I work best with direct questions such as **How should I get started?**. Try to avoid story questions such as **I've been studying Japanese for over a year and feel I have a good foundation. What might be the best way to get started with such a situation?**. These long story questions confuuse me so please try and think of the most direct way to ask me your question. Thank you!"],
