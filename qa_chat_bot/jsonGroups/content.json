    "responses": ["What content to consume is a tricky question to answer and changes based on many things. The article linked below will help you figure things out.\n\n Beyond reading the related articles, here are some things to help you find content.\n\n1. Always prioritize your interests over any hypothetical, optimal path. The more you are interested in the content, the better your focus engagement will be, which is essential to making gains.\n\n2. The Media share section allows you to ask for recommendations, discuss content you consume, and look through the archive to see what others have recommended. Head on over to <#783082970432536608> to gain access to the media share channels.\n3. Finally, check out the community document (linked below) to find content recommendations and resources for all stages.\n\nStage 1 Note: For people in stage 1, we generally recommend focusing on audiovisual content. Anime can be powerful in this stage as it is often more clearly spoken than natural content. The visuals will help you stay interested and engaged with the content during the early phases while comprehension is low. Also, your ear probably won't even hear much of the language correctly in this early stage. By focusing on audio-based content with visuals to keep you interested, you can train your ear to listen to the sounds of the language. At the same time, you chip away at your foundation vocab and grammar."],

      "responses": ["Finding content with subtitles can sometimes be challenging. But here are some primary places to try.\n\n**Streaming Services with subs**\nStreaming services like Netflix and Animelon have a lot of content with matching subs. You can use tools like \"FlixGrab+\" (google it) to download content from Netflix, and \"Subadub\" a chrome and firefox extension to download or select subtitles for easy lookups.\n\nSome content will have Japanese subs available in your country, especially Japanese content that are Netflix originals. But a lot more content will have Japanese subs if you use a working VPN to access Japan Netflix. Check the Refold community document to see which VPN's are currently working.\n\n**Download and find subs / Sub repositories**\nWebsite like Nyaa.si have a lot of Japanese content. Some content will have Japanese subs, but for other content, you will have to find subs. The Refold content and resources community document has a list of subtitle repositories that have subtitle files for thousands and thousands of shows and movies. If the subtitle files don't match, you can check the Tech and Tools document for tools that will help you retime subtitles to fit your media.\n\n**YouTube content**\nThe majority of YouTube content has computer-generated subs. These can be very inaccurate and should not be trusted very often, but just used as a guide. However, some YouTube content does have human-made subtitles. If the subtitle file says \"Japanese\" and not \"Japanese (auto-generated)\", then the subs are probably human-made and can be trusted more. I've linked below a source for finding some human made YouTube subbed content.\n\n** Non-Native Japanese content**\nDubed content subs often don't match. Be careful."],

First off being, if you enjoy anime, then anything that causes you to enjoy your immersion and be engaged in it is incredibly valuable. On top of that, anime voice actors often speak pretty clearly, making the early stages of immersion easier to understand. That being said, anime often has unique language use that most people would not use so once your comprehension is a high level and you move onto stage 3 for output/speaking, you will want to start engaging with more natural speech. But we'll worry about how to do that once we get there! Until then, enjoy your anime!"],

But if you're gonna spend your time playing games, you might as well do it in your target language. Just don't expect significant language gains from this. The exception are visual novels, and some JRPG's. All games are different though, so use your own judgement. In general you want immersion sources with as much language density as possible. Over time, it really does matter.\n\nThat being said, if you are going to play video games, having passive immersion in the background can help. When the game provides little to no active immersion, switching focus to your passive immersion can increase your overall language exposure. It's not as good as language-dense active immersion, but it helps."],
