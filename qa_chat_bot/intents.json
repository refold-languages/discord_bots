Many people have become fluent without ever using Anki or SRS programs.\n\nWith that being said, we recommend using Anki. Learning a language is a long journey, and we genuinely do believe that with Anki, the process will go a little faster. If you find Anki a terrible part of the process, then try not going so hard with it. Even 5 words or less a day can help. Just pick a manageable number for yourself and go with it. Even 5 a day is better than nothing and should keep your review time low and manageable. "

If you start over, you will have to start those known cards fresh, which is a big waste of time. It's better to slowly work through your backlog of due cards. This way, your known cards stay where they are, and forgotten cards begin to refresh.\n\nWith that said, if you wish to restart your deck, the best way is to delete the deck and load it in fresh. This ensures all cards are in the intended order (Make sure you still have access to the fresh Anki deck before deleting the old one). You can also select cards from the Anki browser and right-click them, selecting \"reschedule...\" and sending them to the back of the card queue. This likely will shuffle the cards into a different order than you desired, though, so it isn't preferred."

            "Anki is a supplement to immersion. Many people get into the trap of thinking more Anki means quicker progress. In reality, it's the balance of Anki to immersion that leads to more rapid progress. The recommended amount of cards per day is 10-20, but less is also acceptable. Also, keep in mind that new words will be harder to learn early in the process because you have nothing to associate new words to. So your early cards per day may be much less. Find a balance that works for you.\n\n**Another way to look at cards per day**\nAnother way to look at cards per day is to not add a specific amount of cards per day at all. Some have found success in allotting a time for Anki rather than a card count. My personal recommendation is that you should be doing a MAX (less is fine) of 30 minutes of Anki for every 1.5 hours of immersion (for a total of 2 hours) with an Anki cap of 2 hours. So at 3 hours of immersion, you have 1 hour of Anki (4 hours total), and at 6 hours of immersion, you cap out at 2 hours of Anki and just add more immersion beyond this. I like this method because it ensures that you don't cut into immersion time to keep up on your Anki card goal.\n\nIf you chose the time method above, it's important to note that you always finish your reps for the day. If you run out of time, finish your backlog of cards, but don't add new cards. If you have time, add as many new cards as you can for that day in the remaining time. I do recommend capping your daily cards, though, at 20-30 max, even if you have time remaining, so you trickle cards out and don't have huge swings in cards per day."

You set this number in deck options, and once this number of times failed is reached, Anki will either tag or delete the card; however you have it set up. Refold believes that constantly hunting for easy, low-hanging fruit that is within your range to learn is the best and fastest method to chipping away at the language. Because of this, we recommend setting your leeches at 5 and allowing leeched cards to suspend or delete.\nNote: Every time you get a card wrong, it goes into a **learning** mode. Marking a card incorrect when in learning mode does not add a counter to the leech number. So if you get a card wrong that day, and then that same day you mark it wrong 10 more times without ever getting it correct, this still only counts as 1 leech counter. Only after you mark it correct, then see it again on a different day, will marking it incorrect add a counter to the leech counter."

You want your choices to minimize time and maximize the effectiveness of the SRS so you can spend as much time as possible immersing. The SRS is a supplement to immersion, not the other way around."

            "**__Thoughts on morphman and the two camps__**\n\nMorphman is an addon for Anki that attempts to find 1T sentences from a sentence bank. Thoughts on this are split.  So I'll go over the pros and cons, and you can make your own choice.\n\n    Pros Camp:\n1. It makes sentence mining quick.\n2. Perfect for people with not a lot of time\n3. Can use frequency list to find useful words easily.\n\nCons Camp:\n1. Time save is an illusion as all-time sentence mining is not immersion (as opposed to finding sentence while immersing)\n2. Morphman can be buggy. It often shows you words you have already marked known. Sorting through this wastes more time.\n3. Sentence context is not as concrete and leads to a weaker understanding of the word.\n4. Once you have a little sentence mining experience, mining in immersion is faster and leads to better sentences.\n5. You are often given 2T+ sentences that appear 1T that make the sentence not very high quality to use.\n\nIn the end, it's up to you if you use morphman or not. My Creator (Brett) and many in the server don't like using it. He used to live by it and refused to not use it. When it broke on him, he was forced to sentence mine during immersion, and this was the best thing that happened to him. Being forced into it made him realize how much better an experience it is. However, many also disagree with this and enjoy the addon."

But what about sentence mining and lookup tools.\n\nThere is a tool developed for Androidi by a member of the Refold comunity that I have linked below. This allows for sentence mining and lookups on mobile. Sadly there is no equivelent for iPhone (any devs out there want to port the Android app linked below, post it in the Discord.). Reading lookups and sentence making are possible with the Anki app on and just simple copy paste on iPhone, but for now there is no multimedia card creation tools sadly. Only for android.\n\n(Note: There are always to make it work. On iPhone you can listen to your immersion and try and look up words you don't know just by looking up words by hand in the dictionary. Don't let the tools be the reason you don't continue forward. They are nice, but not nessesary. Get your immersion however you can."

But in short, the goal of stage 1 is to build a foundation. This generally entails 3 daily activities.\n\n**1. Daily Foundation Vocabulary (Anki/flashcards)**\n Slowly work through your vocabulary foundation deck. For more information on foundation vocabulary, ask me \"**How do I get a vocabulary foundation**\".\n\n**2. Browse Grammar Guide**\nFor 10-20 minutes a day, you can help jumpstart comprehension by casually browsing a beginner grammar guide. For more info on grammar, ask me \"**How should I learn grammar?**\".\n\n **3. Immersion**\n This is the most critical element of the process. You want to immerse at least 3 times more than you do Anki (flashcards). For more info on immersion, ask me \"**What do I do when immersing in stage 1**\"."

The article linked below will help you figure things out.\n\n Beyond reading the related articles, here are some things to help you find content.\n\n1. Always prioritize your interests over any hypothetical, optimal path. The more you are interested in the content, the better your focus engagement will be, which is essential to making gains.\n\n2. The Media share section allows you to ask for recommendations, discuss content you consume, and look through the archive to see what others have recommended. Head on over to <#783082970432536608> to gain access to the media share channels.\n3. Finally, check out the community document (linked below) to find content recommendations and resources for all stages.\n\nStage 1 Note: For people in stage 1, we generally recommend focusing on audiovisual content. Anime can be powerful in this stage as it is often more clearly spoken than natural content. The visuals will help you stay interested and engaged with the content during the early phases while comprehension is low. Also, your ear probably won't even hear much of the language correctly in this early stage. By focusing on audio-based content with visuals to keep you interested, you can train your ear to listen to the sounds of the language. At the same time, you chip away at your foundation vocab and grammar."

            "Finding content with subtitles can sometimes be challenging. But here are some primary places to try.\n\n**Streaming Services with subs**\nStreaming services like Netflix and Animelon have a lot of content with matching subs. You can use tools like \"FlixGrab+\" (google it) to download content from Netflix, and \"Subadub\" a chrome and firefox extension to download or select subtitles for easy lookups.\n\nSome content will have Japanese subs available in your country, especially Japanese content that are Netflix originals. But a lot more content will have Japanese subs if you use a working VPN to access Japan Netflix. Check the Refold community document to see which VPN's are currently working.\n\n**Download and find subs / Sub repositories**\nWebsite like Nyaa.si have a lot of Japanese content. Some content will have Japanese subs, but for other content, you will have to find subs. The Refold content and resources community document has a list of subtitle repositories that have subtitle files for thousands and thousands of shows and movies. If the subtitle files don't match, you can check the Tech and Tools document for tools that will help you retime subtitles to fit your media.\n\n**YouTube content**\nThe majority of YouTube content has computer-generated subs. These can be very inaccurate and should not be trusted very often, but just used as a guide. However, some YouTube content does have human-made subtitles. If the subtitle file says \"Japanese\" and not \"Japanese (auto-generated)\", then the subs are probably human-made and can be trusted more. I've linked below a source for finding some human made YouTube subbed content.\n\n** Non-Native Japanese content**\nDubed content subs often don't match. Be careful."

First off being, if you enjoy anime, then anything that causes you to enjoy your immersion and be engaged in it is incredibly valuable. On top of that, anime voice actors often speak pretty clearly, making the early stages of immersion easier to understand. That being said, anime often has unique language use that most people would not use so once your comprehension is a high level and you move onto stage 3 for output/speaking, you will want to start engaging with more natural speech. But we'll worry about how to do that once we get there! Until then, enjoy your anime!"

The exception are visual novels, and some JRPG's. All games are different though, so use your own judgement. In general you want immersion sources with as much language density as possible. Over time, it really does matter.\n\nThat being said, if you are going to play video games, having passive immersion in the background can help. When the game provides little to no active immersion, switching focus to your passive immersion can increase your overall language exposure. It's not as good as language-dense active immersion, but it helps."

We believe you should always prioritize how much you enjoy your immersion over any type of hypothetical, optimal content. If you enjoy the process, you will be more engaged and get a lot more from your immersion.\n\nThat being said, some people love graded readers because they can easily find content that they can have a chance of understanding. If that is the case, then feel free to use graded readers in the early stages. But we recommend trying to move away from them as soon as possible. Others, however, enjoy content based on visuals or what little of the story they can understand, even if it's more complicated. Hunting for that low-hanging fruit and listening for the stuff they DO understand is engaging and fun for them. For those types of people, most likely graded readers will not be very useful.\n\nWe have some graded readers listed in the comunity doucment (linked below) if you decide you enjoy them."

They look at how language is used and then look for patterns and rules from usage.

Over time, you will begin to understand the difference between formal, informal, slang, polite, Keigo, and everything up, down, and in-between. Rather than worrying about the rules of politeness, build a 6th sense for it. This will take a long time. Years and years, but it will happen. Once you are functionally fluent, if there are any grey areas you still can't figure out, you can always ask native Japanese speakers for their input IN Japanese. Until then, don't focus on the things you cant figure out on your own and keep hunting for low-hanging fruit. "

Do whatever you have to do to understand what you are consuming. This does not mean stop and look up every word you don't know to try and understand everything you are consuming. This is not advised to do often. This means to focus on the element preventing you from understanding your immersion.\n\nIn the beginning, this will be the sounds of the language. When you first start, you won't be able to hear the language properly. Most of it will sound like gibberish, so your focus should be on listening as intently as you can to listen to the sounds of the language. Once you start hearing the sounds better, you will begin to start picking out words. Some of the words you will recognize from your flashcards. Others will just be words you have heard in your immersion a lot and stick out. Words will eventually turn into sentences and into groups of sentences, scenes, and ultimately entire stories.\n\nIf you are still confused, try watching the video linked below and ask me some of the related questions.

How much should I immerse?__**\n\nThe short answer is every day and as much as you can without negatively affecting more essential things in your life, like health, job, relationships, etc. The more detailed answer is.\n\nThis is a complicated answer because, in the end, we just don't know. Everyone learns at different rates. It also depends on the quality of your immersion, how well you are at keeping focus, your goals, and many more factors. Assuming you don't speak any other Asian languages, you can assume it will require a significant amount of immersion to reach a high level. That being said, here are some basic benchmarks. (These estimates are a guide only and differ from person to person significantly)\n\n**3 Years to Speaking**\nWe advise getting at least 3+ hours of active immersion and another 3+ hours of semi-active/passive immersion a day to reach the output stage within 3 years. However, by Refold standards, at this point, your comprehension level will be so high that you will already be at a higher level in the language than most ever accomplish.\n\n**Minimum amount**\nWe do recommend trying to get a minimum of 2 hours of active immersion a day. Anything 1 hour or less likely won't lead to satisfactory progress in a language like Japanese.\n\n**There is no limit but be careful**\nThe more you immerse, the faster your progress will be. So if you have time, always opt to get more exposure to the language and hunt down ways to add more immersion time. But don't sacrifice physical or mental health, relationships, your job, and other more important things. Learning a language is excellent, but it won't make your life suddenly perfect. Once you speak the language, you want a life and people to enjoy it with."

Active immersion is immersion where you are entirely focused with the intent to understand it. Your attention isn't divided between other tasks, but rather you are fully dedicated to understanding the content you are consuming. So watching Anime, Movies, reading novels, light novels, watching YouTube videos, and more, are all examples of active immersion.

            "Passive immersion (also sometimes called Semi-active immersion) is any immersion you do when you arent 100% focused on immersion. So this would be immersion when doing laundry, working out, cooking, driving, brushing your teeth. Whatever. The article below goes over passive immersion. But there are two things I want to clarify.\n\n**How much passive immersion should I do?**\nYou want to do as much passive immersion as you can without sacrificing more important things, such as mental/physical health, safety, relationships, your job, etc. That being said, you NEVER want to sacrifice active immersion for passive. Passive immersion is only something you do when you are unable to do active immersion. \n\n**Passive immersion is misleading**\nPassive immersion is a word created to let people know they can always find ways to fit more exposure to the language in, even if they can't fully focus. But in reality, focus is not binary; it's not on or off, black or white. It's a gradient. Sometimes during active immersion, you will lose focus and drift into passive. Other times during passive, you will focus in and get some active. The main thing is, you want to get as much exposure with as much focus as humanly and safely possible in the moment."

The higher quality your immersion, the more benefit. But anything is better than nothing. If you just have Japanese on in the background and paying zero focused attention to it at all, then no, it's not likely to give much benefit. But who knows, it might provide some minor benefit. But, maybe for 2 hours you don't pay attention to it, then you have 30 seconds where you do focus on it because there is a lull in whatever you are doing. Well, for those 30 seconds, you basically get **active immersion** or at least semi-active immersion. Every little bit adds up over time. It's just up to you to decide if it's worth the effort and sacrifice. I think the related question will provide some more useful information potentially."

Because of this, we recommend 30 minutes of intensive immersion a day. If you feel you want to do more, then go ahead and do more. Just be careful you aren't using intensive immersion as a crutch because you can't accept ambiguity. Even with intensive immersion, accepting ambiguity is an important element of the process.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind, if you have much more passive immersion time than you do active immersion, you may want to do a little bit more intensive immersion during your active immersion and then use your passive immersion as the majority of your free flow exposure. But even if this is the case, make sure you are getting a healthy amount of free flow immersion during your active immersion time as well.\n\nBe extra careful to also not burn out doing too much intensive immersion."

            "The answer is different for each stage of the process, so make sure you follow the Refold website's recommended advice. With that being said, here is a short answer. What you chose to read, subtitles, manga, light novels, etc, is up to you. But check related quesitons.\n\nIn stage 1, you want to focus primarily on listening. This way, you train your ear to hear the sounds of the language before associating them to the writing system too much. Watching content with Japanese subtitles isn't exclusively considered reading; it is more a hybrid activity providing clues to what you hear. \n\nIn phase 2, if you chose, you can start reading more. Once you decide to start adding more reading, you want to try and keep your reading and listening comprehension levels somewhat even. So if one gets out of sync, spend more time with that activity to keep them about even.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that interests and goals come into play also. Some care more about reading than listening/speaking and vice versa. So spend time with the activity you care about, just know that too much in one direction, or the other will lead to less skill in the other. Find the balance that works for you. For most people, the recommended ratios and method that Refold lays out should work just fine. What you read and when is up to you. See related qeustions"

If one aspect is stronger than the other (for example, if your reading is stronger than your listening), listen 70 and read 30 percent. If the two are somewhat equal in strength, then immerse in a 50/50 ratio.\n\nThis assumes that you want to keep listening and reading balanced, which we recommend. Some, however, want to be more listening dominants and care about reading less. In contrast, others want to be more reading dominants and don't care as much about listening. So in that case, you will have to find what balance works for you and your goals."

            "Anybody doing Refold for more than a few months knows that immersion is the most critical element of the process. But what are the most essential aspects of the immersion itself? Here are a couple.\n\n**Focus**\nMaking sure you are focused on your immersion fully during active immersion is essential. Don't be checking emails, don't be scrolling social media. Engage in and focused on your content to signal to your brain that this is important. It's impossible to stay 100% focused for hours at a time, but the goal should be to be as focused as humanly possible at all times. Even if all you can muster is glazed eyes after work. Anything is better than nothing, but focus is better than anything.\n\n**Give your brain things to figure out - Be curious**\n You want to watch your content with the intent to understand. The content you consume should be interesting to you. You should WANT desperately to understand it. This will make you hunt down for clues of what things mean. Your brain will take these curiosities and continue trying to figure them out in your subconscious even when you aren't immersing. So don't just go into immersion with the intent to check off your immersion boxes for the day. Remind yourself that this is something you want to understand and enjoy, and then try your best to do it. Even if you fail for a long time."

However, early on, when your comprehension is already low, even when entirely focused, we recommend listening to an audio version of your active immersion content. So once you watch a show, you can turn it into an audio version of the show and listen to it as passive immersion. This gives you more exposure to the vocabulary and concepts you are already learning during active immersion.\n\nThe act of taking a show and turning it into a shorter audio version of itself, with all the dead air removed, is referred to **condensed audio**. I have linked to an old video by MattVsJapan below going over condensed audio; however, the method he shows is now outdated. If you check the Tech and Tools document (linked below), newer condensed audio tools streamline the process.

            "Reading seems to be where the most significant gains in pure language ability are formed. However, too much reading and not enough listening is thought to have negative ramifications on pronunciation, pitch accent instincts, as well as a natural use of spoken vocabulary over written vocabulary. However, it does seem to speed up the process quite a bit. This is why Refold recommends balancing the two the way we do. Focusing on listening only during stage 1 to build a solid foundation and then working into a more balanced approach in stage 2 so you get the best of both worlds. However, depending on your goals, you can balance this however you want. Some may want to go more listening heavy, while others may enjoy going more reading heavy. This will be influenced both by your goals and what type of immersion you enjoy most."

            "Refold recommends focusing on listening first and training your ear to hear the sounds of the language before worrying about reading. There are many reasons for this. I'll touch on them quickly.\n\n1. Gives you time to get a kanji foundation. Decks like the Refold JP1K develop a kanji foundation through exposure to kanji in vocabulary but without testing your ability to read the kanji. This gets you familiar with the building blocks of kanji slowly over time. This gives you time to build that foundation before worrying about putting it to use.\n\n2. Train your ear. Your brain likely can't hear all the sounds of the language when you first start. It takes tons of exposure to the language to even hear it properly, so while you gain a vocab and grammar foundation, it's best to work on building your ability to hear the language since you won't be able to understand what you are consuming anyway. Once you have even a 50 vocab foundation, you will start putting those listening skills to great use.\n\n3. There is some evidence that reading too early can create a link in your mind between the sounds of the language and the writing system. This can cause a slightly lagged listening comprehension experience later on because your brain is always relating it to the writing system rather than just processing the sound. Some believe this \"link\" can't be undone. But even if it can, it takes a lot of time, so we feel to help avoid this, it's best to get a solid listening foundation before reading."

Intensive immersion helps you process the language at whatever speed you need to pick out new vocabulary and new concepts. However, it can also make you overthink the language and interfere with the subconscious natural language acquisition process. So while it's important to use intensive immersion to bring attention to new concepts, you want to also make sure you are getting a lot of free flow immersion so you are solidifying the stuff you know into automatic, fully acquired, pure language skill."

The brain is VERY context-dependent, so you NEED to give it exposure to all these things you are learning in hundreds and hundreds of contexts.

This gives you more exposure to the vocabulary and concepts you are already learning during active immersion.\n\nThe act of taking a show and turning it into a shorter audio version of itself, with all the dead air removed, is referred to **condensed audio**.

            "This is a complicated question that depends on a lot of things. But here is the basic answer.\n\n **Stage 1 - basic**\n I recommend just becoming familiar with pitch accent. Understand it as a concept and know what it is to be aware of it as you immerse. This alone will be incredibly valuable even if you don't go any further with it. Such a small investment can really add up over time, so we recommend doing at least this.\n\n **Stage 1 - A little more**\nIf you arent feeling overwhelmed, and want to take it a bit further, then I recommend learning the pitch patterns and training your ear to hear them in words. Linked below are resources for learning basics about pitch accent and a website to help do maybe 5-10 min a day of basic pitch listening practice.\n\n **Stage-2 - If you dare**\n Once you are in stage 2, you can take it a bit further by starting to learn the pitch for the words you are learning in Anki. The most consuming part about learning pitch accent is learning the pitch of the individual words, so starting to test the pitch of a word in the SRS is something you can start in stage 2. Don't worry about adding this extra level of difficulty earlier. The words you learned up till now are so common they should be easy to fill in later. \n\n **Stage 3 - Ready to Output**\n In stage 3, once you are ready to start outputting, you can get more serious about pitch. Head on over to <#781673820544172034> and ask how to level up your pitch accent when starting to output."

            "It is complicated to answer how long it takes before you understand the language or become fluent. It depends on so many things. How much you immerse, your natural ability, how much time you invest, how focused and how quality the time you spend is, and more. For things like slice-of-life anime, if you immerse a lot in it, it will be quite manageable for you long before fast-paced, mumbled YouTube videos or complex comedy skits. \n\nMy advice is this. Don't focus on how long it will take. Instead, focus on investing time per day. Make that time quality. Stick to it and enjoy your immersion. No matter who you are, it will take a long time to reach a high level in your language. And no amount of worrying about it will make it go faster. So let go of expectations and requirements, investing the time, enjoying that time, making that time focused quality time, and let the progress unfold as it does. The only thing I can promise is, immersion learning is the best way to reach a high, natural level in the language.\n\nFor some rough benchmarks, ask me the related question below so you can figure out a very rough benchmark on time to progress relation."

Many of us truly believe that the \"accept the ambiguity\" advice of the Refold website is really important. We highly recommend you do your best to constantly hunt for low-hanging fruit. Sentences that with minimal effort (a quick dictionary search) you can understand easily. The faster you can train your brain to let go of things out of your reach and keep hunting for this low hanging fruit, the quicker you will make progress. Don't obsess over why something is the way it is; just accept it and continue trying to figure it out over time as you get more examples through additional input.\n\nIt's great that you have questions. But discord/other learners is not where you find answers to those questions. Immersion is where you will find answers to those questions. It's a mindset that will pay dividends as you continue on your journey. Once you brain is primed with a question, it will hunt for the answer in immersion and result in an instinct for the language that no grammar guide, no language learner, and often even, no native Japanese speaker could ever properly explain to you. So, you'll see this a lot, \"the answer is immersion\". \"Acquire\" the language, don't \"learn\" it.\n\nNote: This applies to any questions about language function. \"How are A and B different? How are A and B the same? Why is A this way. Why isn't B this way.\" Whatever modification to the same exact idea you can think of, the answer is the same. \"Immerse more\".\n\nThis is not because we don't want to answer your question. This is because, it's better for YOU that we don't. Happy immersing 🙂"

So don't feel guilty about enjoying a movie in English every now and then. Just try your best to get as much exposure as you can. (It won't cause damage per say, but just removes time you could be spending with your Target Language. This time adds up in the long run, so you want to try ur best to remove it as much as you can and replace it with time in your Target Language. But we are all human, so be kind to yourself.)"

If you ever get sick of a domain, feel free to stray or widen the domain.\n\nDomains are not hard-coded things, but just a concept we created to help section of the language. Anything could be a domain. Anime would be a very wide domain. Drama, horror, fantasy could all be domains but also somewhat broad. Slice of life is a common first domain as it generally deals with the common language used in everyday speech. High school stories with girl protagonists that take place in Tokyo would be a somewhat small domain. The more narrow your domain, the faster you will feel comfortable in it, and the quicker you will reach that level 4 level 5 comprehension ideal for immersion. But also, the more potential there is for becoming sick of the content. So really balancing this is up to you. How small can you make a domain to make good progress, compared to how motivated can you stay.\n\nAs always, remember to prioritize motivation and interest. You will still make progress even if you never stick to a domain. It will just be slower. But slower, enjoyable progress is always better than quicker agonizing progress. And in reality, the fact that you don't enjoy the content anymore will most likely make the more efficient path actually take longer and become less efficient, so don't force a domain too much."

The more you enjoy your immersion and time with the language, the more likely you will stick with this very long process. On top of that, language acquisition benefits from focus and engagement. So being into the story, being into your immersion, enjoying your time will actually help speed up the process, and you will be able to remain more focused for longer. Your brain will pin importance on what it's watching and go to work in the background."

Refold works on finding low-hanging fruit. Hunting down elements of the language that are within your grasp to obtain and understand. To do this, you have to sift through a lot of stuff that is NOT within your range. If you waste time trying to grasp these concepts and understand everything, you will drastically slow down your progress. By accepting ambiguity and being okay with not understanding, you maximize your gains in the language. I've linked an article and a video down below that further explains the importance of accepting ambiguity. This is a crucial concept to understand. I recommend going through both these resources."

If you have some stuff you feel is in your range, go for it, but Refold focuses on finding little chunks of comprehensible input. Sentences here and there. Words here and there. Focus more on finding the content you are interested in and engaged by more so than content in your range. For some people, that interest comes from being comprehensible. For others, it comes from following a subject. Whatever works for you, try and follow it, but don't procrastinate too much by overhunting that perfect piece of content.

Dr. Stephen Krashen has spent his life promoting the Input Hypothesis. The foundation for all immersion learning methods. While Refold searches to find the best way to apply these language acquisition principles in an easy-to-follow, step by steep process, in the end, it all comes down to immersion. Matt, the creator of Refold, has used immersion to reach incredibly high levels in Japanese, along with thousands of others. If Immersion works is not the question. The question is, how much more can we streamline the process."

This is where you take your comprehension in your first domain from comprehension level 3 up to comprehension 5 or 6. There is a lot of vocabulary, phrases, sentence structures, and more in between you and the end of this stage, so it takes a long time. On top of that, you are learning increasingly less common vocabulary, so you will come across each word you learn less and less often. This can make progress feel non-existent even though, in actuality, you are continuing to make significant progress. It can take years, depending on you and your time invested. Patience is the key to making it through this stage, but know you are not alone. Everyone has to trudge through this desert, and the oasis at the end will be all that more satisfying because of the challenge. Sadly there is not trick to make this stage faster other than, just immerse more."

So, scroll down to the sentence mining section and check out the various tools and workflows available and figure out which one works best for you. I suggest you find one that works for you that is quick and easy, learn it, then don't worry about it again. Wasting too much time constantly learning new tools that do something you already know how to do just takes time away from immersion. Invest in a good workflow and use it."

            "What words to make cards from and add to your Anki is a skill that gets better over time. But in short, there are two things you want to keep in mind.\n\n1. How useful do you think the word is. You can use your instincts on this. Obviously, words dealing with complex surgical procedures if you aren't a surgeon or physics terminology if you don't often talk about or engage in physics content would not be that useful. But if you look at the word, figure out what it means, and feel it's a word worth knowing and could be common, then go ahead and add it. If you were wrong about its usefulness later, you can always suspend/delete the card. Or if you pass it up and feel you are wrong, you can add it later. Any word worth learning, you will come across more than once. So don't worry about missing out on a word.\n\n2. If the above criteria is met, then the next thing you want to consider is, do you feel you will remember it the next time you see it. As you get more of a foundation, you'll start to notice that some words just seem to stick. Or are similar to another word you know, and you may feel you don't need the SRS to remember it. Only add a word to the SRS if you feel you need the SRS to remember it. But if you get the feeling that you might remember it without Anki, then don't add it and instead focus on adding words you feel the benefit from adding to your flashcards."

If you sentence mine how we recommend, then yes, it is immersion. Some people see sentence mining as an individual activity. In reality, sentence mining and immersion are one and the same. You don't necessarily want to go into your immersion with a focus on looking for sentences. Instead, you want to focus on understanding your immersion. During that process, you will naturally come across sentences where you think to yourself \"Oh man, I almost understood that. What prevented me from understanding it?\". In these moments, you can go back and investigate with a dictionary. If the sentence is a perfect 1T sentence, a sentence where you can fully understand it once you know that 1 unknown element, you can add it to Anki. So, in reality, sentence mining is a bi-product of immersion and trying to understand your immersion."

However, we very much recommend against this and highly recommend sentence mining for many reasons.\n\n1. Avoiding Anki altogether will likely make the process take much longer. Anki is great at priming things in your mind so that you can acquire them faster in immersion.\n\n2. Premade decks, in our experience, are vastly inferior to sentence mining. There are many reasons for this, but here is one main reason. When you sentence mine, you are actively taking words from the content you enjoy. This will increase the likelihood that you will come across those words again sooner rather than later, which also increases the rate at which you will acquire those words. This increases the rate at which your snowball grows (see related questions) and dramatically speeds up your progress. A short investment in learning the tools to sentence mine will pay dividends in the long run and save you a lot of time compared to relying on premade decks too much. (Most also find that sentence mining helps words stick better than finding even the same word in a premade deck because you understand the full context)"

            "At Refold we recommend you start off with a pre-made foundation deck for the first 1-2k words. After that, you should begin sentence mining your own cards. We do not recommend continuing to use pre-made decks after this initial foundation. However, you can start sentence mining as early as you want. It can be challenging to find proper 1T sentences if you start too early. But if you find a great sentence that you want to mine, feel free to do so.\n\nCareful not to overwhelm yourself with all the sentence mining tools, as there is already so much to learn in the early stages. If you are overwhelmed, fall back on your pre-made deck if you have not learned at least 1k words yet. If Anki is still confusing to you, we also recommend becoming more familiar with the program before venturing out into sentence mining tools."

To give you foundation kanji exposure while teaching you vocabulary simultaneously, so you don't have so much front-loaded work before building out your foundation vocabulary. So doing them together would be a waste of time in our opinion."

The occasional mnemonic that pops into your mind naturally is fine, but wasting too much time trying to create memory tricks to force vocabulary to stick just is not worth the time. This is a strategy that works better for traditional learning, where you hhave to learn informatiion in a specific order and you are tested on it so you have to remember the info that will be on the test. But we feel this slows down your progress in immersion learning. Instead, focus on the words that stick naturally and let the ones that don't stick go for now and try again at a later date. This all plays into our stance on letting leeches leech, low hanging fruit and the snowball effect."

Everybody's journey is different, but the general recommendation is to not output until stage 3. There are many reasons we think this is the best route for most people. First, it gives you time to train your ear to properly hear the language. Second, it minimizes bad habits that can form by speaking improperly. Input helps inform good speaking, but speaking does not help inform comprehension or understanding. So focusing on understanding the language first has a double-dip effect helping improve your comprehension and speaking instincts. Trying to speak early does not double dip and is time spent only working on one skill. Speaking. And possibly improperly at that. Suppose you do, however, choose to ignore our advice or are in a situation where you can't wait to output (such as living in the country). In that case, we recommend only speaking with Natives. Two language learners speaking with each other is a recipe for compounding the harmful effects of early output."

This is because your comprehension wont be high enough before then to even know if the parent you are selecting speaks how you want to speak.

            "Japanese has 3 writing systems. Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji. The first two, Hiragana and Katakana (collectivly refered to often as Kana), are phonetic writing systems.\n\n**1. Kana (Hiragana and Katakana)**\n These are phonetic writing systems. This means that each character has a sound, and it's pretty simple, comparatively, to learn how to read and sound out words (much like the English alphabet). While this is not always true, for the most part, Hiragana is used to write Japanese words and form conjugations. In contrast, Katakana is usually used for loan words (words adapted from other languages).\n\n**2. Kanji**\nKanji, on the other hand, is a pictorial writing system. There are thousands of characters, and each character can have multiple meanings and multiple ways of reading them. This is why we recommend learning kanji the way we do. Even if you could import every kanji into your brain, like in The Matrix, you still would not be able to read Japanese. Without a lot of vocabulary knowledge and reading practice, you would not know which reading to use when reading words you don't know. This is because character meanings and readings change based on what word they are used in. This is why we recommend getting familiar with kanji and then actually mastering kanji through vocabulary and reading rather than boring frontloaded \" kanji learning\".\n\nHiragana: ひらがな\nKatakana: カタカナ\nKanji: 漢字"

            "Refold does not recommend handwriting kanji/kana until after you are fluent. Obviously, if you have a deep drive or reason to do so, go for it. Still, we believe it is less efficient than learning to recognize and read kanji first. You can then focus on writing once your reading comprehension is relatively high.\n\nLearning to write kanji because most communication is done on computers isn't mandatory anymore and is more a personal choice, or for those that live and work in Japan.\n\nSome claim that writing the kanji helps them remember them. While this can be true, the amount of effort and time it takes to do so, we believe, vastly outweighs whatever benefit it might provide. You would get much more benefit just reading and learning more vocabulary.\n\nWith that being said, if you want to learn to handwrite kanji, try RTK (Remembering the Kanji), or just keep a handwritten daily journal and lookup stroke order on the fly to learn how to write kanji. Learning calligraphy and how to write kanji beautifully is beyond the scope of Refold. It should be straightforward to research in Japanese once you are fluent."

            "Refold recommends against any frontloaded Kanji study where you memorize individual kanji meanings and readings out of context. Even if you could import all Kanji meaning and readings into your head, like loading a computer program, you still would not know how to read Japanese. Kanji meanings and readings change significantly based on the word they are being used in, making this out-of-context knowledge not worth the effort and frustration it takes to obtain.\n\nFor this reason, we recommend people get a quick and dirty recognition kanji foundation. After this foundation, proceed with the long journey of mastering Kanji through learning vocabulary and reading. Each time you see the Kanji used in a new word, you will further solidify how comfortable you are with the Kanji. Slowly, you will build an instinct for how a Kanji can be read or what it means. Eventually, you will notice you can often guess the reading and meaning of words you had never seen before. This will happen purely off instincts you built up through past vocabulary and reading."

            "If you are asking about individual kanji then ask me \"How do I learn to read kanji\". If you are asking about vocabulary and how they can sometimes have multiple readings, then here are some of the basics.\n\nVocabulary can have numerous readings for many reasons. Sometimes one is more formal than the other. Sometimes one is more modern than the other. Sometimes it will actually change the meaning. So how can you tell the difference? There are a few ways.\n\n1. Read the definitions for the multiple readings. If the meaning changes, then figure out which meaning fits the context best.\n2. If the meanings are the same, listen to the audio to hear what the native is saying. If you are reading and no audio is available, then I recommend you move on. It's best, especially early on, to move on if you can't find the answer to your questions quickly.\n3. If you are at a high level and still can't figure out the difference, try looking for the answer to your question by googling your question IN Japanese. If you arent far enough along to do this yet, then move on and hunt for low-hanging fruit (things that are easily within your grasp). Don't waste time reaching for something you aren't ready to learn yet."

It was a book designed to teach people how to write kanji by breaking it down to it's core elements, and using those core elements as building blocks to build kanji from.\n\nRRTK = Recognition Remembering the Kanji. This is a modified version of RRTK (once called Lazy kanji in AJATT) designed to take RTK and gear it towards immersion learning and only providing just enough kanjii exposure to see the characters as individual characaters rather than squiggly lines. You then take that foundation and master kanji through learning vocabulary and actually reading.\n\n**Should you do RTK or RRTK or JP1K?**\nRTK is way to much of an investment for learning to read. It was designed for learning to write kanji. You might use it after you are fluent and looking to write kanji, but we do not reccomend using the RTK method to learn to read or early in the process.\n\nRRTK is a decent way to get a recognition kanji foundation, but is no longer recomended. The Refold JP1k deck is recomended because it gives you foundation exposure to kanji while teaching you foundation vocabulary at the same time. This saves you some time and headache. However JP1k deck is premium deck available at the link below. If you don't want to buy a premium deck then then RRTK is recomended before starting vocabulary.

Still, they can also be combined with other kanji in chaotic and elegant ways to form different words. This is why kanji have many meanings and many readings. This complex system is also why we don't recommend learning kanji from its meaning and readings but instead through vocabulary."

A quick and dirty foundation in the Kana should take a few days or less, and then master the kana by actually reading as laid out in the Stage 1 Japanese Guide (linked below). Don't wait to MASTER the kana before moving on. Just feel comfortable with them and continue to master them as you immerse.\n\nAs far as kanji goes, you want to get a quick and dirty kanji foundation. If you do RRTK this will take a month or two. If you do JP1k, you will get this foundation along with your vocabulary. Beyond that foundation, it will take years to learn kanji, because you will master kanji through vocabulary and reading.

            "We do not recommend WaniKani for many reasons. One reason is, it's a paid service. Second, it teaches vocabulary along with kanji, which causes you to HAVE to learn their vocabulary in the order they tell you. WaniKani has something like 5000+ vocabulary before you are finished. We recommend moving on to sentence mining at around 1-1.5k vocabulary. In order to finish WaniKani and get the full kanji foundation it promises, you have to do up to 5 times the recommended premade deck vocabulary before sentence mining. We believe sentence mining to be vastly superior method for learning vocabulary. It's really up to you, but we see no real benefit to WaniKani as a system pertaining to an immersion-based language acquisition method.\n\nIf you are willing to pay for a kanji/vocabulary foundation, we recommend checking out the Refold JP1K deck that is specifically designed to be used along with the Refold Method."

            "The point of RRTK (not to be confused with RTK) is to give you enough familiarity with kanji that they look like individual characters rather than squiggly lines. Its purpose is not to learn and grind all the keywords, readings, or any of that. Instead, mastering the kanji will be accomplished through learning vocabulary and reading later on. So once you have achieved this goal and can quickly tell even two similar kanji apart if they are side by side, you can move on to vocabulary. \n\nSome people chose to rep their current RRTK cards for another couple of weeks, while others just suspend or delete the whole deck right away. This is really up to you."

            "Getting a feel for kanji is a long, slow trickle process. No matter how much JP1K, RRTK, RTK, whatever you do, kanji will still be a long journey that is frustrating at times. With that being said, we believe the best way is to just keep learning vocabulary and keep reading. You will forget readings, you will get kanji confused, and get frustrated over and over. This is all part of the journey. But slowly, over time, you will build an instinct for the kanji. You will slowly start to notice that even words you don't know, you will begin to understand how it's read and what it might mean just from the kanji. This is a long process, though, so be patient, and most of all, don't be hard on yourself. Struggling with kanji is something we all go through, and the more you accept it as a long journey filled with obstacles, the easier time you will have with it."

But in short,  we recommend getting a quick kanji foundation and then mastering kanji through learning vocabulary and reading. You can do this in one of two recommended ways.\n\n**1. Refold JP1K Deck**\nFor those that don't mind purchasing a premium deck for quality and convenience, we recommend the Refold JP1K deck. This deck gives you a kanji foundation while learning vocabulary.  This means no wasted time as you start working on a solid foundation for immersion from day 1.\n\n**2. RRTK - Recognition Remembering The Kanji**\nThis method is free but has more frontloaded kanji study before getting into vocab and immersion. You can find a full explanation as well as the link to the RRTK Anki deck in the \"Unofficial Stage 1 Japanese Guide\".\n\n For more details, check out the resources linked below.\n\n Make sure to check out all resources in <#784120941650509865> if you have not already."
